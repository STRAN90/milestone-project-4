# About
This is a full-stack e-commerce project built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created a website for 'CookBookNook' designed to sell cookbooks.


#
# UX
## Strategy
Using core UX principles, I began with strategy, considering the target audience and the features they would find valuable.

The target audience for 'CookBookNook' includes:

- Home cooks, chefs, and culinary enthusiasts looking to expand their recipe repertoire,
- Individuals interested in exploring new cuisines and cooking techniques.

These users will be seeking:

- An informative website with easy-to-find and concise information about cookbooks.
- A platform that offers a variety of cookbooks to suit all needs. 
- The ability to browse, view, and purchase cookbooks available for sale.
- Features such as user accounts for managing billing history, wish lists, and writing reviews
- Subscription options for receiving updates on new cookbook releases and culinary trends.

This website will provide all these functionalities while ensuring intuitive navigation and ease of use.
